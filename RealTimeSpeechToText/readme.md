I used HTML to create the structure for the web page with the buttons and every element on the page (index.html)

also, I used CSS codes to make the style of the page (index.css)

and I programmed a PHP page to get the data that the user entered and saved in the database (values.php)

I used Apache HTTP Server Version 2.5 (Local Server) localhost I created 2 separated tables , and in (db.php) I create the connection between the web page and the database

table 1 for the 6 motors (contains 7 cloumn "motor1" ...."motor6" + ID)

table 2 for the motion (contains 5 cloumn "forward - right - left - backward" + ID) The ID is created automatically and incremented with each data entered

lastly the /assets folder to save all needed libraries like jQuery
